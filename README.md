What is Reform?
---------------

Reform is an vector graphics application featuring direct manipulation programming.

It is based on Bret Victor's talk "Drawing Dynamic Visualizations".

Currently it is still under development. Feel free to contribute!

### Demo

The current version requires Swift 3 and XCode 8 beta to compile. You can checkout [an earlier commit](https://github.com/laszlokorte/reform-swift/commit/cc60e82c4f37755a24798f1eaaee22ba4f49e5cc) to compile in XCode 7. A compiled version [can be downloaded here](https://github.com/laszlokorte/reform-swift/releases)


When will it be released?
